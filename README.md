## **Dataset and Survey Structure**  

### **Survey Categories**  
The dataset consists of **demographic data** and responses across several key categories:  

1️⃣ **Understanding of Training Content** – Comprehension of key concepts and strategies.  
2️⃣ **Skill Development** – Improvements in decision-making and situational awareness.  
3️⃣ **Attitude Changes** – Impact on perceptions and confidence levels.  
4️⃣ **Integration of Learning** – Application of training in real-world situations.  
5️⃣ **Module Effectiveness** – Overall usefulness of the training module.  
6️⃣ **Activity Helpfulness** – Effectiveness of specific module activities.  
7️⃣ **Course Integration** – Relevance of training content to coursework.  
8️⃣ **Information Quality** – Effectiveness of provided information.  
9️⃣ **Support Received** – Quality of assistance during training.  

💡 **Responses** are measured on **Likert scales** (e.g., 0-5 or 1-7), with **text-entry feedback** for qualitative insights.
